	<h2 class="fade-in fade-in-2">AUREUM</h2>
	<h3 class="fade-in fade-in-3">Peaxy Aureum® empowers universal access to data, allowing your company to gain control over unstructured and structured data assets and making it easy to find, mine, manage and reuse information across silos, data types, applications and infrastructures (on and off premises).</h3>
	<p>It’s no small task to gain control over exponentially growing data assets spread across the entire enterprise. The growth and increased complexity of unstructured data is accelerating and exerting extreme pressure on IT infrastructures beyond what they were intended to handle. This means that “crown jewel” datasets “go dark,” which hampers the success of new business models like industrial predictive maintenance and digital twin technology.</p>
	<p>Aureum’s data access capabilities speed up time-to-value. We enable a broad set of stakeholders to readily find and analyze your company’s most valuable data. Using Edge Computing workflows, Aureum aggregates and prepares unstructured data for advanced analytics and data visualization.</p>
	<p>Aureum enables enterprises to realize productivity gains by empowering teams with self-serve access, search and management across data types and silos. This saves time when you locate data and increases sharing across teams. It can recover weeks or months of time lost on task duplication when the right information can’t be found for maintenance or new product development.</p>
	<p>Aureum delivers reliable access to data across silos, so teams can more accurately predict maintenance cycles and enable more efficient and cost-effective services. Aureum data aggregation and search can speed service delivery, accelerate development of new products from existing products and uncover opportunities for new revenue streams from data insights.</p>
	<p>Aureum is hardware–agnostic and runs on industry standard commodity hardware for a lower cost of ownership. It is built to run over heterogeneous hardware, so enterprises can mix and match vendors, form factors, hardware generations and types of storage devices. Across this ecosystem, Aureum offers a single namespace that aggregates all devices. Automatic tiering, built-in redundancy and self–healing reduce manual interventions, further lowering costs. This keeps the solution cost effective lowering the total cost of ownership more than 50 percent.</p>

				    <h1>Handling High Scale</h1>
				    <p>The Aureum architecture scales out organically. It decouples the namespace from the data stores, and distributes the namespace across servers, making it fully expandable with parallel access to data while eliminating performance bottlenecks, even for small files. This unique architecture allows customers to grow their storage infrastructure as needs dictate, even to exabyte scale with linear performance.</p>

				    <h1>High Availability</h1>
				    <p>To ensure high availability, the architecture is self-healing. It features remote and local replication to ensure that data is always available. Replication of up to four copies of both data and namespace is supported across servers to ensure data survives even when you lose entire servers (depending on the level of redundancy used).</p>
					<p>The system also ensures data integrity through the use of Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs) for both metadata and data, and can self-heal by retrieving any affected data from a replica server. Use the Asynchronous Replication feature for disaster recovery services through remote replication. Asynchronous Replication is also used to replicate data between sites working at exabyte scale.</p>

				    <h1>Flexible Data Management</h1>
				    <p>Aureum is as easy to use as it is powerful. Virtually anyone can configure the system, keeping information management as close as possible to those who use the data.</p>
					<p>Combining user-defined storage classes with data management policies, Aureum ensures that data resides on the hardware that best fits the requirements. A comprehensive dashboard enables easy configuration by users with appropriate access. This allows enterprises to easily set organizational data policies and storage classes across all data managed by Aureum.</p>

				    <h1>Peaxy® Find</h1>
				    <p>Peaxy® Find helps categorize, catalog, parse and thread data on the Aureum platform instantly. The immutable pathname ensures that as the system is scaled out, data is never lost and can be stored for the long term across technology refreshes.</p>
					<p>Find capabilities are fully integrated with other Aureum data management functions. Aureum's data classes aggregate data sets by project or data type regardless of the file pathname, group or user. Find can utilize data classes to create more useful data catalogs and digital threads. The system indexes data whenever it is created or modified, eliminating the need to periodically crawl the entire infrastructure and improving overall performance and speed. Our technology also enables rich metadata tagging for speedy discovery and retrieval of data.</p>

				<div class="carousel-caption">
				    <h1>Security Levels</h1>
				    <p>A three-level security architecture provides strong authentication. Security levels include authentication only, message integrity checking, and encryption.</p>
					<p>The first level uses Kerberos®, X.509 certificates, and HTTPS to ensure that only authorized machines and users can connect to Aureum.</p>
					<p>The second level adds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305">Poly 1305-AES</a> cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) on each data packet to ensure that the contents of a message have not been tampered with or altered.</p>
					<p>The third level provides full 256-bit authenticated encryption on the wire, to protect data across locations.</p>

				    <h1>Advanced Analytics Support and Interoperability</h1>
				    <p>Today’s enterprises are aggregating, mining, and analyzing data to gain insights using the Hadoop open source framework for distributed processing of large datasets. Ingesting and storing data in Aureum provisions the data set with robust data services, including management and availability, search, and security.</p>
					<p>Support for POSIX® and HDFS guarantees a robust, stable, highly available, and high-performance foundation to ingest and store data in Aureum, and to perform computations on it with Hadoop or Spark.</p>
					<p>A fully clustered SAMBA server is integrated with Aureum to allow efficient interoperability with Windows-based clients. This approach provides scalable performance and resiliency against machine failures by distributing the load across virtual machines and providing failover capabilities.</p>
					<h1>Hardware Agnostic</h1>
					<p>Aureum is hardware-agnostic and runs on industry-standard commodity hardware to reduce cost of ownership. It is built to run across heterogeneous hardware, so enterprises can mix and match vendors, form factors, hardware generations, and types of storage devices while still offering a single namespace that aggregates all devices.</p>
